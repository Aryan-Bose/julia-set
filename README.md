## Fractal Explorer — Julia & Mandelbrot Visualizer
Fractal Explorer is an interactive Python-based visualization program that generates beautiful mathematical fractals including Julia Sets and the Mandelbrot Set.

The application renders high-resolution fractals using optimized numerical computation and smooth coloring techniques to produce detailed, visually appealing patterns. Users can explore fractals in real time by zooming into different regions and exporting high-quality images for wallpapers, artwork, or educational use.

This project demonstrates the power of mathematical visualization, complex numbers, and iterative algorithms while combining performance optimization with real-time graphical interaction.

Key highlights include:

. Real-time fractal rendering

. Smooth color gradients for detailed visuals

. Interactive zoom exploration

. High-resolution image export

. Support for both Julia and Mandelbrot fractals

Fractal Explorer is designed for learning, experimentation, creative exploration, and scientific visualization.
